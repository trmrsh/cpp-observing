The 'observing' software is a small set of programs of use during astronomical
observing. Most useful perhaps are programs which keep track of orbital phase coverage
('whatphases') and which print out phase, airmass, parallactic angle for
a group of objects. I use these extensively while observing.

I hope you enjoy them!
